###Dependencies

Files that can be obtained independently but are still needed to run Familiar Faces are included here. This is mainly for convenience and is used by !build_dist_deps.cmd to create all-in-one files for distribution.

All files in this folder will need to be present (along with the contents of scripts/source/headers) in order to compile certain Familiar Faces scripts.
