<ul>
<li>There will be new builds posted often. Please make sure you're running the most current build before reporting an issue!</li>
<li>
<strong>RaceMenu users</strong>: This download bundles a test version of chargen.dll, a crucial component of RaceMenu. Please backup your current RaceMenu files, presets, and character slots BEFORE installing Familiar Faces!</li>
<li>Again, please install this test release ONLY if you're quite familiar with Skyrim mods in general, the Skyrim folder structure, and how your mod manager (if you use one) operates. Read the compatibility notes below fully.</li>
</ul><p>Got all that? Then feel free to download the current beta! Be sure to check the compatibility and testing notes below!</p>

<h2>
<a name="current-build-is-060-download" class="anchor" href="#current-build-is-060-download"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current build is 0.6.0: <a href="vMYC_FamiliarFaces060.7z">Download</a>
</h2>

<hr><p>This is a development version of Familiar Faces. Though severe bugs should be largely absent, some features may change slightly between now and release. <strong>Be ready to give up any save files you make with this mod installed when the final version comes out. Upgrades from beta to release will not be supported!</strong> </p>

<p>Unless I have given you specific permission to do so, please do not use footage from the beta in review videos, as it is still not quite complete. </p>

<h2>
<a name="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Latest version of Skyrim - Dawnguard and Dragonborn are supported but not required.</li>
<li>SKSE 1.7.0 - Not included. Download and install if you're not using it already. Earlier versions WILL NOT WORK. The mod will notice if SKSE is missing and will shut down.</li>
<li>SkyUI 4.1 - Not included. Required for using MCM.</li>
<li>JContainers 0.67.1 or higher - Included. This is an SKSE plugin that is packaged with this testing edition.</li>
<li>CharGen.dll - Included. This is a special testing version of Expired's CharGen Extender SKSE plugin. See the Warnings section below. If you are running the release versions of CharGen Extender or RaceMenu, BACK THEM UP BEFORE INSTALLING FAMILIAR FACES.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12933/?">Extensible Follower Framework</a> - Not required, but recommended for follower management. UFO and AFT should also work, but EFF is specifically supported.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10753/?">Auto Unequip Ammo</a> - Not required, but recommended to help your imported followers (who frequently have several types of ammo on them) pick the best ammo for their current weapon.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="compatibility" class="anchor" href="#compatibility"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compatibility</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dawnguard and Dragonborn are supported but not required.</li>
<li>Mods that add NIOverride overlays (body tattoos, scars, glowing face tattoos, etc) to RaceMenu are fully supported, though the overlays may not always appear on the Shrine statue. </li>
<li>Enhanced Character Edit (ECE) is <strong>NOT</strong> compatible with Familiar Faces and likely won't be any time in the near future. I have contacted the author about adding compatibility functions to ECE, but thus far they are unwilling or unable to do so.</li>
<li>HDT physics mods almost certainly will not work properly. See <a href="https://code.google.com/p/hdt-pe/issues/detail?id=2">this page</a> for more information. HDT body mods <em>may</em> work but have not been tested. HDT hair definitely will not work.</li>
<li>Body replacer mods such CBBE should be compatible. Face replacer mods should work (provided they don't rely on ECE), but exported characters will probably not load properly if the face-altering mod is removed.</li>
<li>Some ENB setups may interfere with ImageSpaceOverrides, meaning some animations that normally fade to white to hide animation glitches will not do so. Please let me know if you're using ENB (and which preset you're using) if you are reporting animation bugs.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>You can use NMM or MO to install the mod from the 7z file. Other managers such as Wrye have not been tested, but should work. You can install manually simply by extracting the 7z file to the Skyrim/Data directory.</p>

<h3>
<a name="mod-organizer-note" class="anchor" href="#mod-organizer-note"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mod Organizer note</h3>

<p>Familiar Faces does work with Mod Organizer, but files that get created during gameplay will be written to the OverWrite directory instead of to FF's mod tree. This is normal, but it does make MO show a warning. These files can be safely moved into the Familiar Faces tree after you exit Skyrim. Also note that if you need to send me the contents of Data/vMYC, you'll have to pull them from MO's Mod or Override directory instead of your Skyrim installation folder.</p>

<h2>
<a name="uninstallation" class="anchor" href="#uninstallation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Uninstallation</h2>

<p>Make sure all followers provided by Familiar Faces are dismissed from your service before removing the mod.</p>

<p>If you plan to reinstall the mod, leave the Data/vMYC directory intact or at least back it up. It contains all the saved character data. Otherwise...</p>

<p>If you used NMM to install, uninstallation will work but may leave files behind in Data/vYMC. If you used MO, files may remain in your Override directory in the same location.</p>

<p>Search for and remove ALL files and folders in Skyrim/Data that begin with "vMYC". Remove JContainers.dll and the included version of CharGen.dll if you aren't using them for any other mods.</p>

<h2>
<a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started</h2>

<p>Shortly after starting or loading a game, you should receive a Portal Stone in your inventory. You can use that stone from your Inventory (under misc items) to warp to the Shrine of Heroes. Activate the "Tome of the Dragonborn" in front of an empty alcove to save your character there. The save process will take some time, dependent on how many skills, perks, and inventory items your character has. It should never take longer than a minute of real time and should rarely take longer than 30 seconds unless you have a huge number of inventory items. </p>

<p>Once your character has been saved in an alcove, a statue of them will appear, possibly surrounded by various trophies and banners. These reflect your progress and which paths you chose in your adventures through Skyrim. The trophies available are listed below.</p>

<h2>
<a name="meeting-your-character" class="anchor" href="#meeting-your-character"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Meeting your character</h2>

<p>Now for the fun part! Load up a saved game on a different character. As before, use the Portal Stone (there may be a delay before it gets placed in your inventory, just wait). The first time you visit the Shrine, your other saved characters will be loaded in. This process may take some times, depending on the number of characters, how many custom items they have, etc. Open the Tome of your saved character to send them into the world as NPCs. They will have a default spawn point which can be changed from within MCM. After changing their spawn point, you will either need to wait for them to travel to their new home, or summon them back to the Shrine by closing their book, then open it again. </p>

<p>Upon talking to your imported character, you should be able to recruit them as followers (see a Note on VoiceTypes below). You can also make them a marriageable lover or your worst enemy via MCM.</p>

<p>After that, just play around with your imported character! </p>

<h2>
<a name="mcm" class="anchor" href="#mcm"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MCM</h2>

<h3>
<a name="character-options" class="anchor" href="#character-options"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Character Options</h3>

<p>In the MCM panel, you can change some aspects of your characters' behavior as well as how they level. Under Character Options, first choose the character you want to edit. This will bring up their info. </p>

<h3>
<a name="enable" class="anchor" href="#enable"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Enable</h3>

<p>This turn the character on and off. This is mostly a debugging feature but may be useful if they become stuck or their mesh does not get applied properly. Avoid using this unless you have specific reason to do so. It will probably become a debug option in the final release.</p>

<h3>
<a name="voicetype" class="anchor" href="#voicetype"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>VoiceType</h3>

<p>This changes the voice your character uses. This is more important than you might think, because VoiceTypes also affect whether you can recruit, marry, or adopt children with your imported character. If you want to recruit your character, you will need to give them a VoiceType labeled as "Follower". If you are using EFF or another Follower manager, you can switch their VoiceType back to their original one after recruiting, otherwise you will need to keep them on the Follower VT to access the various Follower commands via conversation.</p>

<h3>
<a name="class" class="anchor" href="#class"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Class</h3>

<p>Changing their <strong>Class</strong> determines how their skill points are distributed based on level. By default they will try to follow a pattern based on the original character, but this can deliver mixed results: the preset classes are more reliable and are the same types the game uses for leveled NPCs. </p>

<p>Setting their class will also change how the character selects their weapon, which in turn affects their combat style. Experiment with these until your character acts the way you want them to!</p>

<h3>
<a name="hangout" class="anchor" href="#hangout"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hangout</h3>

<p>This controls where your character will spawn in the world, as well as where they will go if dismissed from your service. At the bottom of the list are custom locations: exercise caution when using these, as they are still a bit buggy and may result in your character getting stuck in limbo. Summoning them back to the Shrine by closing their book will bring them back if this happens.</p>

<h3>
<a name="shrine-of-heroes" class="anchor" href="#shrine-of-heroes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shrine of Heroes</h3>

<p>Here you can rearrange the order in which characters appear in the Shrine of Heroes. In future you will be able to summon/banish characters from the Shrine as well. </p>

<h2>
<a name="reporting-a-bug" class="anchor" href="#reporting-a-bug"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reporting a bug</h2>

<p>Please check the list of Quirks and Known Bugs below before reporting! See the section on enabling Papyrus logging for info on how to generate log files.</p>

<h3>
<a name="if-the-game-crashed" class="anchor" href="#if-the-game-crashed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>If the game crashed:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make a copy of the Papyrus log and all contents of Data/vMYC before you relaunch the game.</li>
<li>Send those files to me, along with any problems you noticed before the crash and what you did leading up to it.</li>
<li>If you can consistently reproduce the crash, be sure to tell me how.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="if-not" class="anchor" href="#if-not"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>If not:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Take screenshots if they will help demonstrate the bug in question.</li>
<li>Make a copy of the same files as listed above AS SOON AS YOU EXIT THE GAME. It's important that you make a copy of the files before you start playing again, as they will get changed the next time you start the game up.</li>
<li>Send me the copied files and a report of what the bug was, what you were doing when it happened, and a brief outline of the steps that brought you to that point.</li>
<li>If you can reliably reproduce it, tell me how.</li>
</ul><p>Use Github Issues to report bugs. If you can't do that for some reason, send bug reports to: <a href="mailto:verteiron+ffbugs@gmail.com">verteiron+ffbugs@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="testing-setupenabling-papyrus-logging" class="anchor" href="#testing-setupenabling-papyrus-logging"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing setup/Enabling Papyrus logging</h2>

<p>If your current mod setup is stable, feel free to use it with Familiar Faces. Please make sure it <em>is</em> stable, though. If you find a bug, I may ask you to try to reproduce without certain mods loaded, so be sure you know how to enable/disable mods on your load list.</p>

<p>If you find a bug, it will be really helpful to have a Papyrus log to send me so I can try to figure out what happened. Make sure the following settings are present in your Skyrim.ini:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ini"><pre><span class="k">[Papyrus]</span>
<span class="na">bEnableLogging</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">1 </span>
<span class="na">bEnableTrace</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">1 </span>
<span class="na">bLoadDebugInformation</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">1</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The Papyrus log will be located in your Documents folders under <em>My Games/Skyrim/Logs/Script/</em> and will be named <em>Papyrus.0.log</em>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="quirks" class="anchor" href="#quirks"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quirks</h2>

<p>The following are not bugs and should not be reported:</p>

<ul>
<li>The game will hiccup or hang for a moment when entering the Shrine. This is a side effect of loading the CharGen data and can't be avoided. It should only occur when the character models are loading or when changing a character's Class via MCM.</li>
<li>Saved characters will quickly vanish and reappear after you load your game. Prior to disappearing they will either be headless or have distorted faces. This is normal.</li>
<li>Characters will vanish for a second when their Class is changed via MCM. This is normal.</li>
<li>Some characters in the shrines may be in mannequin poses, others may not. This is due to how Skyrim handles loading models and can't be avoided easily.</li>
<li>The Portal Stone may take nearly a minute to appear in your inventory. This is normal and will vary based on how many characters you have saved in the Shrine.</li>
<li>If your character is a Vampire/Vampire Lord, they may suffer from the gray-face bug. This is an issue with Dawnguard vampires and probably can't be fixed without making the mod dependent on Dawnguard.esm. If need be I'll distribute two versions of the mod to address this problem.</li>
